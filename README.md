# Ethical Hacking

[Penetration Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test) or ethical hacking is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system and possibly physical security systems associated therewith.  The pen test is performed to evaluate the security of the system.  The test can identify vulnerabilities, including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.
